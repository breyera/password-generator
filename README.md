# password-generator

## This Repository 

In this project I was tasked with using starter code and building out the JavaScript to create a working password generator. When someone clicks on the generate password button, they will be prompted with questions to choose if they want to include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and/or special characters. 

I included multiple while loops to make sure users conformed to the requirements - choosing a password between 8 and 128 characters as well as at least one form of characters.
